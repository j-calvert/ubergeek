REQUIREMENTS (for running it)

Need to have ant, java (<=1.5) and bash on a *nix machine, with 256M of available memory.

BUILDING

In the directory where this README is found, do the following, though this is not actually necessary as
the class files are already present in the build directory.

> ant

RUNNING

> run.sh <trainingFile> <testingFile> <numNeighbors>

OVERVIEW

The code is standalone, depending on no external libraries.

The class with the main method that is run by run.sh is PredictorTester.java.  It creates a Populator,
which loads the training file's data into memory via the MemStore class.  An instance of MemStore
is returned, which is used to construct an instance of a Predictor.  Predictor is an abstract base
class that is extended to a concrete implementation that defines the predict(int userId, int movieId)
method.  The method returns an array of predictions, one for each nearest neighbor computation for
the N nearest neighbors where N = 1 ... <numNeighbors> (as defined above).

The PredictorTester class has a static class PredictorHarness that is used to accumulate error rates
and output the results to standard out.

The duality of movieID and userID was deliberately maintained (there is no apriori distinction between
the two in the code) so that nearest neighbor calculations could be done along both dimensions.  Taking
advantage of this duality is at the foundation on the improvements made to the basic nearest neighbor
algorithm.
